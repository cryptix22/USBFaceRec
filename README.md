# USBFaceRec
Simple USB camera facial recognition for the RPI. This is a modified version to optimize FPS preformance when using a USB camera instead of a picamera.
It will only now work with a USB video camera source as I removed the picamera2 support from the code, and only used the OpenCV librairy.

These scripts have been modified from the ZIP file that is used in Core Electronics facial recognition tutorial.

I followed this for initial setup of the python virtual enviroment and installing all the requirements.
After the setup, download the Face Recognition folder with git clone, or the download button, and use the scripts for optimized USB camera support.

I downloaded the original files before modification from the 
guide on the Core Electronics website: https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/raspberry-pi/face-recognition-with-raspberry-pi-and-opencv/

You should subscribe to Core Electronics as he was very detailed and easy to understand. Its what got me into facial recog and model training!!!

This is my first time making a repo on GitHub, its a little confusing. So bare with me.
