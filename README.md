# USBFaceRec
Simple USB camera facial recognition for the RPI. This is a modified version to optimize FPS preformance when using a USB camera instead of a picamera.

These scripts have been modified to only support USB cameras as a video source. It will not support the camera header as it was removed from the code.

I followed a tutorial from Core Electronics on YouTube for initial setup of the python virtual enviroment and installing the system-site-package: face_rec
Follow the turorial on setup, then when the time comes to run the python recognition scrips for training or gerneral use you can simply use my modded version.

You can either clone them with git or download directly from GitHub then extract the folder from the ZIP and then you are good to go.
