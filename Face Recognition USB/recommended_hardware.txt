This library can be ran on multiple types of hardware but mostly have seen it used with the raspberry pi.

I tested this library on the Raspberry Pi 5 that has 4GB of memory. I also attached a heatsink with a included fan to provide optimal cooling,
as when hardware gets hotter, it can harm the preformace of the PI

This is a modified version that allows USB camera support using OpenCV. The original version can also support USB, but it was designed for using the picamera header,
thus slowing USB capture preformance. The other issue was the color formatting.

There are many factors that can impact preformance and isnt always directly related to the code. After I struggled for an hour or two of getting the origial script to have correct color with the USB camera and smooth framerate,
I decided to adjust it for only USB support, which fixed the colors and also improvecd the FPS greatly. 

I obtained nearly 25 FPS on the RPI5 with a logitech C920 USB camera in ideal light conditions. I have not tested it on a RPI3 yet but I'm sure its functional and does the job.

Majorty of the code is original and only snippets have been adjusted with the help of OpenAI o3-mini-high GPT model. The original authors are referenced in the main Face Recognition folder in licenses
